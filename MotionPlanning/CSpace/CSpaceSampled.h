  \brief This class represents a sampled-based configuration space. This is the main class for RRT-related planning.
 
 A CSpace is defined by a set of robot nodes and a collision manager. 
 The RobotNodeSet specifies the dimension and the borders of the CSpace.
 The collision manager is used to check configurations for collisions. Here,
 multiple sets of objects can be defined which are internally mutually checked for 
 collisions. This allows to specify complex collision queries.
 The sampling-based c-space relies on two parameters: The sampling size, which specifies
 the (c-space) distance between two succeeding configurations on a path segment. This 
 parameter affects how many intermediate configurations are added when creating new paths.
 The second parameter is called DCD sampling size, where DCD stands for discrete collision detection.
 This parameter is needed for the check if a path segment is valid or not. Therefore intermediate
 configurations on the path segment are checked for collisions with the given maximum distance between two
 neighboring intermediate configuration. This parameter affects both, the performance (the Rrt approach spends 
 most of the time for collision detection) and the reliability of the results. Since there is no guarantee that
 all potential configurations are detected with sampling-based approaches, a large DCD sampling parameter
 will increase the chance of missing a collision.

 Constraints can be considered by adding instances of ConfigurationConstraintPtr.
